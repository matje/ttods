Feature: BasicTest (Zone2) on ODS wiki passes successfully
    In order to ship OpenDNSSEC
    As a developer
    I want to know that the BasicTest passes

    Background:
        Given a clean DB setup
        And a new zone "Zone1" with policy "Policy1"
        And a new zone "Zone2" with policy "Policy2"
        And keys are generated for policy "Policy1"
        And keys are generated for policy "Policy2"
        And "update conf" is issued


Scenario: Check Zone2 at set times
      When I run enforcer
        And I load new keys for "Zone2"
        Then I should see 1 new active ZSK keys in the "Zone2" signconf
        And I should see 1 new prepublished ZSK keys in the "Zone2" signconf
        And I should see 0 new retired ZSK keys in the "Zone2" signconf
        And I should see 1 new active KSK keys in the "Zone2" signconf
        And I should see 0 new retired KSK keys in the "Zone2" signconf
        And I should see 1 "publish" KSK in key list for "Zone2"
        And I should see 1 "dssub" KSK in key list for "Zone2"

        Given I issue ds-seen for all "dssub" KSKs in "Zone2"
