Feature: Emergency ZSK rollover at scheduled time
    In order to ship OpenDNSSEC
    As a developer
    I want to know that the emergency ZSK rollover works

    Background:
        Given a clean DB setup
        And a new zone "Zone1" with policy "Policy1"
        And a new zone "Zone2" with policy "Policy2"
        And keys are generated for policy "Policy1"
        And keys are generated for policy "Policy2"
        And "update conf" is issued

    Scenario: Check Zone1 at set times
      When I run enforcer
        And I load new keys for "Zone1"
        Then I should see 1 new active ZSK keys in the "Zone1" signconf
        And I should see 1 new active KSK keys in the "Zone1" signconf
        And I should see 1 new prepublished ZSK keys in the "Zone1" signconf
        And I should see 0 new retired ZSK keys in the "Zone1" signconf
        And I should see 0 new retired KSK keys in the "Zone1" signconf
        And I should see 1 "publish" KSK in key list for "Zone1"
        And I should see 1 "dssub" KSK in key list for "Zone1"

        Given I issue ds-seen for all "dssub" KSKs in "Zone1"
        And I move 5 minutes into the future from the start of the test
        And I run enforcer
        And I load new keys for "Zone1"
        Then I should see 1 old active KSK keys in the "Zone1" signconf
        And I should see 1 "dspublish" KSK in key list for "Zone1"
        And I should see 1 "ready" KSK in key list for "Zone1"

        Given I issue ds-seen for all "ready" KSKs in "Zone1"
        Given I move 10 minutes into the future from the start of the test
        And I run enforcer
        And I load new keys for "Zone1"
        Then I should see 1 old active KSK keys in the "Zone1" signconf
        And I should see 1 "dsready" KSK in key list for "Zone1"
        And I should see 1 "active" KSK in key list for "Zone1"

        Given I move 15 minutes into the future from the start of the test
        And I run enforcer
        And I load new keys for "Zone1"
        Then I should see 1 old active KSK keys in the "Zone1" signconf
        And I should see 1 "dsready" KSK in key list for "Zone1"
        And I should see 1 "active" KSK in key list for "Zone1"
        # standby key enters dsready state

        Given I move 20 minutes into the future from the start of the test
        And I run enforcer

        And I should see 1 old prepublished ZSK keys in the "Zone1" signconf
        And I should see 0 new retired ZSK keys in the "Zone1" signconf

        And I should see 1 old active KSK keys in the "Zone1" signconf
