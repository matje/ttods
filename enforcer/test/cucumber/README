Cucumber tests for enforcer
---------------------------

These tests implement (amongst other things) the test
specification at :

https://wiki.opendnssec.org/display/OpenDNSSEC/System+test

(Zone2 KSK has still to be added)

REMEMBER TO BUILD THE ENFORCER WITH THE ENABLE_TIMESHIFT OPTION!!

These tests use the Cucumber testing tool to perform
behavioural testing of the enforcer and ods-ksmutil
tools. To run these tests, you must have ruby and
cucumber installed. To install cucumber :

gem install cucumber

To run the tests, run :

cucumber

from this folder.

More comprehensive documentation will be available in
due course.
