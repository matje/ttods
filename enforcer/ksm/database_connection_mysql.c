/*+
 * DbConnect - Connect to Database
 *
 * Description:
 *      Creates a connection to the specified database using the parameters
 *      supplied.  If successful, the handle to the connection is stored
 *      locally, for retrieval by DbHandle().
 *
 *      Should there be an error, a suitable message is output.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 		DB_HANDLE* dbhandle
 * 			Address of a location into which the connection handle is put.  This
 * 			is also stored locally for retrieval by DbHandle().  If this argument
 * 			is NULL, no handle is returned through the function call.
 *
 * 			Note that if a handle for an active connection is already stored
 * 			locally, this function will overwrite it, regardless of success or
 * 			failure.
 *
 *      const char* database
 *          name of database (NULL to pick up the default).
 *
 *      ...
 *          Optional arguments.
 *
 *      For the MySql implementation, the following additional arguments are
 *      required:
 *
 *      const char* host
 *          Host to which to connect.
 *
 *      const char* password
 *          Associated password
 *
 *      const char* user
 *          Username under which to connect.
 *
 * Returns:
 *      int
 *          0       Success
 *          Other   Error on connection.  The message will have been logged via
 *                  the MsgLog() function.
